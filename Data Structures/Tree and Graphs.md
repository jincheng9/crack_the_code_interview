## Trees1. Binary Tree (BT) -> Binary Search Tree (BST) -> Balance Binary Search Tree (AVL and Red-Black Tree)2. Binary Tree -> Full Binary Tree (满二叉树), Complete Binary Tree (完全二叉树)3. Basic operations in Trees  * Tree traversal: pre-order, in-order, post-order## Heaps or Binary Heaps(二叉堆， 也是一种完全二叉树，数组实现)## GraphsBasic operations in Graphs1. DFS (recursive)2. BFS (implement using a queue)
