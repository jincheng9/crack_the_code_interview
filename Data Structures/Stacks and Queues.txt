Basic concepts in Stacks and Queues:
(a) Stack: pop(), push(), top(), empty(), size()
(b) Queue: enqueue(), dequeue(), front(), back(), empty(), size()

3.1 Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
==========
Solution:
1. Use fixed array allocation for the three stacks, and then implement each stack on its own array space.

3.2 Design a stack with three functions: push(), pop(), and min(). Push, pop, and min should all operate in 
O(1) time. min() returns the minimum element.

Solution:
1.
