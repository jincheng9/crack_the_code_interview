1.1 Implement an alogorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional
data structures?
-----------------------
Solution: 
1. Use an array of length 26 to store the number of each chracter (from 'a' to 'z'), if there is an element larger
than 1, then this string doesn't have all unique characters. (O(n))

2. If we cannot use additional data structrures, then we can use a double for-loop to compare the characters in 
the string, if there exists the same character, then the string doesn't have all unique characters. (O(n^2))

or sort the characters in the string, and then traverse all characters to compare the neighbouring characters. (O(nlg(n)))
