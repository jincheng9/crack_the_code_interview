### Basic concepts in mathematics and probability
1. Prime numbers
	* all positive integers can be decomposed into a product of primes. 
	* gcd(x, y) * lcm(x, y) = x*y
	* check for primality of integer n 
		* check 2, 3, ..., n-1
		* check 2, 3, ..., sqrt(n)
		* cross off the number divisible by 2, then 3, 5, 7, ...
2. Probability
	* P(A and B) = P(B|A)P(A)
	* P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
	* diffference between independence and mutual exclusivity
		* independence: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
		* mutual exclusivity: P(A and B) = 0
