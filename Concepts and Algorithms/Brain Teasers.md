### 1. two ropes, each needs 1 hour to burn. How would you use them to time exactly 15 minutes. Note that the ropes are of uneven densities, so half the rope length-wise does not necessarily take half an hour to burn.

Solution:

1. Light rope 1 at both ends, and rope at one end.
2. When the two flames on rope 1 meet, 30 minutes will have passed. Rope 2 has 30 minutes left of burn-time.
3. At that point, light rope 2 at the other end.
4. In exactly 15 minutes, rope 2 will be completely burnt. 

### 2. Nine balls, one heavier, the other 8 balls have the same weight. You are given a balance which tells you only whether the left side or the right side is heavier. Find the heavy ball in just two uses of the balance. 
Solution:

1. Split the balls into three groups, each group has 3 balls. 
2. Weight the 1st group and the 2nd group using the balance. 
3. If the 1st group and the 2nd group have the same weight, then the heavy ball is in the 3rd group. Choose any two balls in 3rd group to weight, if they are in euqal weight, then the remaining ball in the 3rd group is the heavy ball. If the 1st group or the 2nd group is heavier, then we can use the same method to find the heavy ball in the heavier group.

### 3. We have 20 bottles of pills, one bootle with 1.1 grams pills, the other bottles only with 1 gram of pills. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement. Use the scale only once to find the heavy bottle. 
Solution:

1.  Pick i pills from bottle i, assume the 1.1 grams pills are in the jth bootle, then the sum should be 
sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + j-1 + 1.1*j + j+1 + ... + 20. Thus j = (sum-(1+2+...+20))/0.1.
